# App Logic
Since this project is uploaded to the Microsoft Store, there are several files containing sensitive information. For the sake of simplicity, I decided to only upload the the .cs and .xaml files I created, as well as the assets I used.

# Note
This app is NOT affiliated with Overwatch or its parent company in any way.
